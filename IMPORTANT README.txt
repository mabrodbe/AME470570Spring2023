Hi!
My code is a little weird but it works if:
    1. Upon Loading the page you upload a normal image (not a profile pic)
    2. then upload a profile picture
    3. then click on the menu button, and it will update upon loading the main feed.
    4.if these steps dont work try refreshing. it does work I promise I just wasn't able to get it seamless.
