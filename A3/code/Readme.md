Steps I took to get my website hosted on AWS.
1. Make an AWS account.
2. I went to S3, and made a new bucket.
3. Next, I enabled public access, and made it so it would open up "index.html"
4. Then I made a policy, which I copied from a github link. It is the basic policy I saw in multiple tutorials.
5. Next, I uploaded my index.html and all the other files necessary to the bucket.
6. I then tested it by opening it in my broswer on my computer and my phone.
